# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



## Project Overview:
  
  1. This project is designed as a online bike selling platform in which people can easily buy and sell bikes.

  2.While doing this project,i for the first time use useQuery, with JWT Token as well as Stripe Payment Gateway Method
  
  3.As I worked on this project, I also studied CRUD operations. Through the POST, PATCH, GET, and DELETE methods, I was also able to see how beautifully data can be created, read, updated, and deleted.

  4.I also used both Google Auth and Email and Password Verification for buyers and only Email and Password Verification for sellers  method for creating simple authentication .

  5 AdminRoute, SellerRoute are being used for admins and sellers .One cannot access to these section without log in as seller or without declared as admin by another admin .
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
